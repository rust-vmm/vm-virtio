// Adding a `M: GuestAddressSpace` generic type parameter here as well until we sort out the
// current discussion about how a memory object/reference gets passed to a queue.
// We might end up with the queue type as an associated type here in the future, if it makes
// sense to define an interface for queues which abstracts away whether they are split or packed.
// On the other hand, if we split the queue into a config/state part and a live part, then we'd
// only need to work with the configuration here, and there's no need for generic type parameters
// or associated types related to that.

// We're currently relying on macros from the `log` crate to output messages (as do other modules
// from `vm-virtio`). This is temporary solution until we agree on a better alternative going
// forward since different customers most likely have different expectation around levels,
// messages, formatting, etc.
