# virtio-vsock

The `virtio-vsock` crate provides abstractions for the components of the
[vsock device](https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html#x1-39000010).
For now, it offers only an implementation for the vsock packet.
The support is provided only for stream sockets.

The vsock device is a socket device that can be used as a communication
mechanism between the host and the guest. It is implemented using the virtio
standard. The vsock device has three queues: an RX one, a TX one and an event
one. In a simplified manner, the communication between the host and the guest
is realized with the buffers that are exchanged using the deviceâ€™s queues.
These buffers are called packets in the vsock device context.

## Vsock Packet

### Design

The virtio vsock packet is defined in the standard as having a header of type
`virtio_vsock_hdr` and an optional `data` array of bytes. There are multiple
operations that can be requested within a packet, e.g. `VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RST`
for resetting the connection, `VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW` for sending payload. Most
operations are of the `VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW` type, which means for data transfer,
and the other ones are used for connection and buffer space management.
`data` is non-empty only for the `VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_RW` operations.

The abstraction used for the packet implementation is the `VsockPacket`.
It is using
[`VolatileSlice`](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/blob/fc7153a4f63c352d1fa9419c4654a6c9aec408cb/src/volatile_memory.rs#L266)s
for representing the header and the data. We chose to use the `VolatileSlice`
because it's a safe wrapper over the unsafe Rust's raw pointers, and it is also
generic enough to allow creating packets from pointers to slices. Going with a
`GuestMemory` based approach would not make such configuration possible.
More details (including design
limitations) in [the `packet`'s module-level documentation](src/packet.rs).

A `VsockPacket` instance is created by parsing a descriptor chain from either
the TX or the RX virtqueue. The `VsockPacket` API is also providing methods for
creating/setting up packets directly from pointers to slices.
It also offers setters and getters for each `virtio_vsock_hdr` field (e.g.
*src_cid*, *dst_port*, *op*).

### Usage

The driver queues receive buffers on the RX virtqueue, and outgoing packets on
the TX virtqueue. The device processes the RX virtqueue using 
`VsockPacket::from_rx_virtq_chain` and fills the buffers with data from the
vsock backend.
On the TX side, the device processes the TX queue using
`VsockPacket::from_tx_virtq_chain`, packages the read buffers as vsock packets,
and then sends them to the backend.

### Examples

Examples of usage can be found as documentation tests in
[the packet module](src/packet.rs).
